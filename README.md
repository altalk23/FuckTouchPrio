# Better Touch Prio

This mod simply fixes touch issues by using Z order to calculate the button to be pressed instead of the touch priority value.

This fixes issues like being able to press buttons behind unclosable popups, or touch detecting layers being clickable behind popups!

If you like my work you can support me from my [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/alk1m123)!
